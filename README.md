# Slic3r-settings
Slic3r settings for my Prusa MK2S in a heated enclosure.

I tend to print hot, fast, and with a fan so the settings reflect this. Most time has been spent tuning the "0.20mm FAST" print setting, along with [eSUN ePC](http://amzn.to/2BdW8Xp), the Makergeeks ABS and PETG, and Taulman Bridge (which I also use with [eSUN ePA](http://amzn.to/2BKiagC) filament). The rest are unmodified defaults, I only included them for the sake of maintaining consistent settings between computers.
